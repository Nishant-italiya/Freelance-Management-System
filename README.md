## Database Management System to Store and Manage Data of the Freelancing Website
Timeline: February 2024 - April 2024

# Objective of the Project
Develop a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) for a freelancing platform to efficiently manage freelance projects and facilitate seamless connections between project owners and freelancers.

# Description of the Project
The system enables project owners to upload project details that are visible to all freelancers, who can then submit bids for these projects. Project owners select the freelancer that best meets their requirements based on submitted bids. The platform supports effective communication between freelancers and project owners throughout the project lifecycle. Projects are divided into milestones, with payments released to freelancers upon the completion of each stage. After the project's completion, project owners can provide feedback and ratings, which reflect the quality of the work delivered.
