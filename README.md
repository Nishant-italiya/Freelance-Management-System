# ðŸ’¼ Freelance Management System

A complete **Database Management System (DBMS)** project designed for a freelancing platform where **project owners** and **freelancers** connect, collaborate, and complete projects smoothly.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To design and implement a fully functional and normalized database that:
- Manages freelance project data
- Connects freelancers and project owners
- Tracks milestones, payments, bids, messages, and feedback
- Ensures data integrity and smooth workflow

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The system enables project owners to upload project details that are visible to all freelancers, who can then submit bids for these projects. Project owners select the freelancer that best meets their requirements based on submitted bids. The platform supports effective communication between freelancers and project owners throughout the project lifecycle. Projects are divided into milestones, with payments released to freelancers upon the completion of each stage. After the project's completion, project owners can provide feedback and ratings, which reflect the quality of the work delivered.
